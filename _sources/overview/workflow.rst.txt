XMake utilizes the ``xmake.lua`` file and the ``.xmake`` cache folder
for project configuration. To start, create an xmake project by using
the ``xmake create`` command in your desired directory. Then, configure
the project by editing the project configuration file or by running the
xmake config command to fine-tune the settings. After you are done you
can build the project with ``xmake build`` and run it with ``xmake run``
