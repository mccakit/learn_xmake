Hi, as C/C++ developers we spend a lot of time dealing with build
systems. This is frustrating, because this is an afterthought in other
languages. These languages have standardized build systems and package
managers. These systems work without much headache on your side.

Xmake was created to bring that same level of simplicity and automation
to C/C++ ecosystem, letting you focus more on writing code and less on
wrestling with build scripts

I created this document to provide a more easygoing learning experience
for the people just starting out.
