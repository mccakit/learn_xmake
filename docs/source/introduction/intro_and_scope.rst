 Why This Guide Exists
#######################

Hi, as C/C++ developers we spend a lot of time dealing with build
systems. This is frustrating, because this is an afterthought in other
languages. These languages have standardized build systems and package
managers. These systems work without much headache on your side.

Xmake was created to bring that same level of simplicity and automation
to C/C++ ecosystem, letting you focus more on writing code and less on
wrestling with build scripts

I created this document to provide a more easygoing learning experience
for the people just starting out, as the main documentation is hard to
read

#################
 Who This Is For
#################

This document is written for C/C++ developers of intermediate level, I
expect you to know the ecosystem to some capacity and the general
terminology. For those planning to use XMake effectively, you should
have:

-  Working knowledge of C/C++ development
-  Basic understanding of build systems and their purpose
-  Familiarity with common compiler flags and options
-  Understanding of dependency management in C/C++ projects
-  Some experience with project configuration concepts
