We structure our documentation using this `framework
<https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/>`_ to make it easy
to read and navigate. This system divides content into four clear
categories:

-  Tutorials – Teach users how to achieve a goal step by step
-  How-To Guides – Show users how to solve specific problems
-  Reference – Provide detailed technical information
-  Explanation – Clarify background concepts and ideas
