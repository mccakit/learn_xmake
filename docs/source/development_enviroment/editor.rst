This document uses Zed Editor because itâ€™s lightweight and works well
with CLI tools. To configure a language, install the extension and
specify the paths to your LSP and formatter binaries in the project
settings.

#. Install Zed Editor

    .. code::

        scoop install extras/zed

#. Install desired extensions via the Extensions tab in Zed

#. Install additional LSPs and formatters using tools like scoop, pip or npm

#. Configure project settings by creating a project settings file and adding paths to your tools as needed
